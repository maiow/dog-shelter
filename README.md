What we've used here:
- Modularization
- Dagger2
- Single Activity
- Gradle.build on Kotlin / BuildSrc 
- Jetpack Navigation
- Splash Screen API
- Custom View
- ViewPager2, TabLayouts
- Material3 Design
- Adaptive Layouts - Constraint Layout
- Firebase Auth, Storage, Realtime database
- Delegate Adapters
- Stream Chat - left in 'chat' branch for history as Stream is not granting free-of-charge plans anymore, this to be replaced by own chat
- Much more is coming...
